# Airbnb Clone Project

## üöÄ Project Overview
The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive backend application simulating a scalable property booking platform like Airbnb. It focuses on backend architecture, database design, API development, asynchronous processing, and application security. This project demonstrates a fully functional, production-ready backend integrating modern technologies such as Django, PostgreSQL, GraphQL, Celery, and Docker, with CI/CD pipelines, caching strategies, and API documentation.

## üèÜ Project Goals
- **User Management:** Secure registration, authentication, and profile management.  
- **Property Management:** Creation, updating, retrieval, and deletion of property listings.  
- **Booking System:** Manage bookings, including check-in/check-out details.  
- **Payment Processing:** Handle transactions securely and record payment details.  
- **Review System:** Enable users to leave reviews and ratings.  
- **Data Optimization:** Fast data retrieval and efficient storage through indexing and caching.

## üë• Team Roles
- **Backend Developer:** Implements API endpoints, business logic, and database schemas. Ensures functionality meets requirements.  
- **Database Administrator:** Designs and optimizes the database, manages indexing and relationships between entities.  
- **DevOps Engineer:** Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling using CI/CD and containerization.  
- **QA Engineer:** Tests functionality, identifies bugs, and ensures the application meets quality standards.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technology Stack
- **Django:** Web framework for building RESTful APIs.  
- **Django REST Framework:** Simplifies API development and CRUD operations.  
- **PostgreSQL:** Relational database for storing structured data.  
- **GraphQL:** Flexible API query language for efficient data retrieval.  
- **Celery:** Handles asynchronous tasks like notifications and payment processing.  
- **Redis:** Caching and session management to improve performance.  
- **Docker:** Containerization for consistent development and deployment environments.  
- **GitHub Actions:** CI/CD automation for testing and deploying changes.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Design
**Entities and Key Fields:**  
- **Users:** id, username, email, password, profile_info  
- **Properties:** id, title, description, price, owner_id  
- **Bookings:** id, user_id, property_id, check_in, check_out  
- **Reviews:** id, user_id, property_id, rating, comment  
- **Payments:** id, booking_id, amount, payment_status  

**Relationships:**  
- A **user** can have multiple **properties**.  
- A **booking** belongs to one **user** and one **property**.  
- A **review** is associated with a **user** and a **property**.  
- A **payment** is linked to a **booking**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Feature Breakdown
- **User Management:** Handles registration, authentication, and profile updates to provide secure access and personalization.  
- **Property Management:** Enables hosts to create, update, and manage listings, ensuring accurate property data.  
- **Booking System:** Allows users to reserve properties, manage schedules, and track bookings.  
- **Payment Processing:** Secures financial transactions and tracks payment history.  
- **Review System:** Lets users submit ratings and feedback, supporting informed decisions.  
- **Database Optimizations:** Uses indexing and caching to improve response times and efficiency.  

---

## üîí API Security
- **Authentication:** Ensures only registered users can access protected endpoints.  
- **Authorization:** Restricts actions based on user roles (e.g., only owners can update their listings).  
- **Rate Limiting:** Prevents abuse by limiting the number of API requests.  
- **Data Protection:** Sensitive information like passwords and payment details are securely stored and transmitted.  
> Security is crucial to protect user data, ensure safe transactions, and maintain trust in the platform.  

---

## üöÄ CI/CD Pipeline
CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) automates testing and deployment to ensure consistent, error-free releases.  
- **Purpose:** Automatically build, test, and deploy changes to reduce manual errors and speed up development.  
- **Tools:** GitHub Actions for automation, Docker for consistent deployment environments, and Celery for background tasks.
