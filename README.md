# Airbnb Clone Project

## üöÄ Project Overview
The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive backend application designed to simulate a scalable property booking platform like Airbnb. It focuses on backend architecture, database design, API development, asynchronous processing, and application security. This project demonstrates a fully functional, production-ready backend integrating modern technologies such as Django, PostgreSQL, GraphQL, Celery, and Docker, with CI/CD pipelines, caching strategies, and API documentation.
